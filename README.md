# Sokoban

Sokoban written using Vanilla JavaScript with only HTML and CSS, so no canvas.

There's an event queue for the sake of UX, which is not fully tested yet. Possibly there are some improvements to be done.

So it is just a snapshot at this moment. And it may remain thus, since this game is just a small exercise to have some fun.
